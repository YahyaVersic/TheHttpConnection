# TheHttpConnection

Goal: Server-Client Programs to exchange actual files and not just json-based data

## Roadmap
Server:
1. DONE RestController with Spring Boot to accept GET-Requests
2. DONE return JSON Object
3. return an actual FILE
4. Post Mapping: Upload Json, Files etc. (later managing bigger files)

Client:
1. (Java) Client to send HTTP GET Requests to server above
2. Client to receive JSON objects and read them
3. Client to receive actual Files (i.e. PDF)
4. If this works we can do the same with other languages to explore differences (python, go, ...)
